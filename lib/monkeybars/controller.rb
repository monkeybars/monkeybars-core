  # Controllers are the traffic cops of your application.  They decide how to react to
  # events, they coordinate interaction with other controllers and they define some of
  # the overall characteristics of a view such as which events it will generate and how
  # it should respond to things like the close button being pressed.
  # For a general introduction to the idea of MVC and the role of a controller, 
  # please see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller.  Monkeybars is not, 
  # strictly speaking, an MVC framework.  However the general idea of the seperations 
  # of concerns that most people think of when you say 'MVC' is applicable.
  #
  # The controller defines the model and view classes it is associated with.  Most
  # controllers will declare a view and a model that will be instantiated along with
  # the controller and whose life cycle is managed by the controller.  It is not required
  # to declare a view or model but a controller is of questionable usefulness without it.
  #
  # The controller is where you define any events you are interested in handling
  # (see add_listener) as well as two special events, the pressing of the "close" button
  # of the window (see close_action), and the updating of the MVC tuple (see update_method).
  # Handlers are methods named according to a certain convention that are the recipient of events.  
  # Handlers are named <component_event>.
  # No events are actually generated and sent to the controller unless a listener has been added 
  # for that component, however, component-specific handlers will automatically add a listener 
  # for that component when the class is instantiated.  Therefore a method named 
  # ok_button_action_performed would be the equivalent of 
  # 
  #   add_listener :type => :action, :components => ["ok_button"]
  #   
  # These automatic listener registrations work for any component that can be
  # resolved directly in your view.  In the above example, the view could contain
  # a component named ok_button, okButton or even OkButton and the listener
  # would be added correctly.  If you have a nested component such as text_field.document
  # then you will need to use an explicit add_listener registration.
  # 
  # Handler methods can optionally take one parameter which is the event generated
  # by Swing.  This would look like
  # 
  #   def some_component_event_name(swing_event)
  #
  # Automatic listeners can also be decorated with a trailing ! to indicate that the
  # update_view method should automatically be run on completion of the callback being
  # run from a Swing event.  In the previous example
  #
  #   def some_component_event_name!
  #   end
  #
  # is the equivalent of
  #
  #   def some_component_event_name
  #     update_view
  #   end
  #
  # While an event handler is running, the Swing Event Dispatch Thread (usually called the EDT)
  # is blocked and as such, no repaint events will occur and no new events will be proccessed.
  # If you have a process that is long running, but you don't want to make asynchronous
  # by spawning a new thread, you can use the repaint_while method which takes a block to execute
  # while still allowing Swing to process graphical events (but not new interaction events like
  # mouse clicking or typing).
  #
  #   def button_action_performed
  #     repaint_while do
  #       sleep(20) # the gui is still responsive while we're in here sleeping
  #     end
  #     model.text = "done sleeping!"
  #     update_view
  #   end
  # ==========
  #
  # Example of a controller, this assumes the existance of a Ruby class named MyModel that
  # has an attribute named user_name that is mapped to a field on a subclass of 
  # Monkeybars::View named MyView that has a button named "ok_button" and a text field called 
  # user_name
  #
  #   require 'monkeybars'
  #   
  #   class MyController < Monkeybars::Controller
  #     set_view :MyView
  #     set_model :MyModel
  #
  #     close_action :exit
  # 
  #     def ok_button_mouse_released
  #       puts "The user's name is: #{view_state.model.user_name}"
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # It is important that you do not implement your own initialize and update methods, this
  # will interfere with the operation of the Controller class (or if you do be sure to call
  # super as the first line).

    #
    # The set_model method may be used in 3 different ways.
    #
    # The first and most common use is to pass the name of the model class as
    # a string. Internally the controller instantiates this class and makes it
    # available to the controller via a private method #model. Note that this
    # form of set_model does not allow passing any parameters to the model
    # class, thus the model must implement a zero-argument constructor.

    #    set_view 'FooView'
    #    set_close_action :exit
    #  end
    #
    # The second format passes a block to set_model. The block is executed via
    # #instance_eval with the result assigned as the model. The construction of the
    # model is fully under your control.
    # 
    #  class FooController < ApplicationController
    #    set_model { FooModel.new("arg1", "arg2", "arg3") }
    #    set_view 'FooView'
    #    set_close_action :exit
    #  end
    # 
    # The third format takes both a string with the model class name _and_ a block
    # for the purpose of setting initial values. The block will be passed the model
    # object.  No parameters may be passed to the constructor in this format.
